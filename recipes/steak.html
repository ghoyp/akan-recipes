    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Steak has always been my go-to dish for when I feel like spoiling myself. Anyone that tells you steak needs anything more then salt, pepper, and butter, are steering you into the wrong place. We're keeping it simple today.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Preferred Cut of Steak</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Stick of butter</li>
        <li>A cast iron skillet</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First we'll need to get our skillet hot. Put it on the stove at medium heat. Make sure your skillet is pre-seasoned. I season my skillet with canola oil or olive oil sometimes. You want to season it with an oil that has a high smoke point since skillets can get very hot.</li>
        <li>Make sure you had your steak pre seasoned as well. I like to presalt and wrap up my steak and set it in the fridge for about 30 or so minutes. This lets the salt seep into the meat itself and keep it tender. When you put your steak into the skillet, you lose over 30 percent of the seasoning you used in the first place. That's why it's important to preseason. </li>
        <li>Once the skillet is hot enough and place your steak in the pan</li>
        <li>Let the steak cook for about a 90 seconds on each side. When you flip the steak to the original side, prepare your stick of butter.</li>
        <li>Take a teaspoon of butter and drop it into the skillet, you'll need a spoon to start basting the steak.</li>
        <li>Baste the steak for about 20 seconds on each side.</li>
        <li>After another 90 seconds, you can take the steak out to rest. Depending on your preferred cook, you may need to cook the steak longer. I prefer my steaks medium rare.</li>
        <li>After letting the steak rest for about 10 minutes, you can proceed to slice it into pieces or just serve it as a whole.</li>
    </ol>
